In this homework activity, I used all the skills I have learned until now - focusing on using APIs as part of the technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.

**1- Personal Finance Planner** : This allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

**2- Retirement Planning Tool** : I used the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. Then, I used the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
